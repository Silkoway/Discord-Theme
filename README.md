# Discord-Theme
A chrome extension for customising discord themes.

Discord Theme uses `.dtheme` files to change the theme.
It changes the colors that the variables use for discord.
Everything that has the form of `#foo={bar}` is a property of the file. 
There are 2 required properties and those are `#name={}` and `#author={}`.
Everything else is custom!

### Note: This project has been abandoned in favor of using BetterDiscord
